debathena-maybe-krb4-config (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Because we already have packages depending on krb4-config, it's always
    going to be in apt's cache. Instead of trying to test for that, just
    use the version number of krb4-config's source package to figure out
    if it's still around.
